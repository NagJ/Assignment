Morse Code

The Problem

Morse code is a way to encode messages in a series of long and short sounds or visual signals. During transmission, operators use pauses to split letters and words.

Please write a program which will translate lines of Morse code into readable English text. The program should:

Accept a flat file as input.
Each new line will contain a string of Morse code. The characters used will be:
. = dot
- = dash
|| = break
Output the English text for each line
Sample Input

-..||---||--.

â€¦.||.||.-..||.-..||---||||.--||---||.-.||.-..||-..

Sample Output

dog

hello world
